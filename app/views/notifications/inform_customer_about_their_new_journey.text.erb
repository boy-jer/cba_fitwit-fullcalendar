Congratulations on committing to a new fitness challenge, and welcome to the FitWit community!

In the week leading up to the camp start date, you will receive a pre-camp email that
will include helpful camp information, a fitness camp manual, and nutrition guide.
Please note that we'll be holding a kickoff session that includes a weigh-in and
body measurements from 9-11AM on the Saturday immediately prior to the first day
of camp.  The pre-camp email will indicate the specific location, but please save
the date and time.

If you have any questions, please give us a call at 1-888-5-FITWIT or reach us by email at info@fitwit.com.
