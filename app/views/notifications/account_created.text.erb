Dear <%= @user.name %>,

You are now able to register for an upcoming 4-week fitness camp. If you’ve already done so, you’ll receive a confirmation email with information about starting the FitWit program.

In addition to our 4-week camps, we also offer a variety of convenient membership options to match your motivation and schedule.  Nearly 80% of current FitWitters are FitWit Club Members, and prices range from $135 to $205 per month. We also offer membership discounts for couples, teachers, students, military, law enforcement and first-responders.

If you choose not to register for a 4-week camp online at this time, we will contact you in the next week to discuss how FitWit can best help you meet your fitness goals.

Many thanks,
Josh Guerrieri
Founder and President
FitWit, LLC

PS - I've attached a report we put together on how to get more out of your workouts. It's good food for thought with a bit of our fitness philosophy.  Get fit!
