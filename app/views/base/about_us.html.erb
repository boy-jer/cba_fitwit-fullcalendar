<h2>History</h2>

<p>FitWit is an Atlanta company, created by Josh and Erin Guerrieri in 2005. At the
time, both Josh and Erin were teaching and coaching in inner-city Atlanta Public
Schools, and they saw the need for quality fitness and tutoring programs for the
students they served. The combination of these two programs - personal fitness
training (FIT) and academic tutoring (WIT) - proved to be an effective blend in
addressing a traditionally underserved student population.</p>


<p>While FitWit launched new programs for students, it also began molding its defining
program - the adult fitness camp. These early fitness camps evolved into what is
now the ground-breaking FitWit training program devoted to challenging fitness
across all elements while tracking performances and building community within
the participants. Josh Guerrieri, a NCAA national qualifier in the decathlon and
American Council on Exercise-certified personal trainer, created the FitWit program
from his own athletic experience and cutting-edge research that explores how
people best improve their total fitness level. Thus, a new fitness genre was born -
group fitness training with an emphasis on individual performance improvement
and a commitment to building community within the camp and neighborhood.</p>


<p>The original camp in Grant Park in Atlanta has seen exponential growth since
its inception. Proof of FitWitâ€™s effectiveness lies in its 90% retention rate (those
campers opting to sign-up for consecutive camps) an extremely high rate for any
fitness program. Fearing a watered-down version of the original camp, FitWit has
been slow to grow to other locations, instead opting for recruitment and training
of quality trainers to carry out the mission. But in 2008, the FitWit program was
successfully replicated in Decatur, Georgia, and we added a third location in
Midtown Atlanta.</p>


<p>The increased interest in these fitness camp programs created opportunities for
more time slots and new locations, but it also took some resources away from the
student programs. So much so that it become necessary to recommit to the origins
of FitWit. This renewed commitment came in the form of The FitWit Foundation -
a non-profit organization empowering young people to lead healthy and successful
lives. Though a completely separate entity from FitWit LLC, FitWit donates 5%
of its profits from every adult fitness camp to The FitWit Foundation. The FitWit
Foundation is then able to create exciting fitness and tutoring programs that are
then offered FREE to low-income young people in the Metro-Atlanta area. Hence, the
original vision of FitWit is being fulfilled, building community through fitness.</p>
