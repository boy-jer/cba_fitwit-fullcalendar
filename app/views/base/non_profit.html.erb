  <h3>
    Our Story
  </h3>

  <p>
    In 2005, husband and wife team Josh and Erin Guerrieri both taught and coached in inner-city Atlanta Public Schools.
    They saw they need for quality fitness and tutoring programs for the students they served. The combination of these
    two programs — personal fitness training (Fit) and academic tutoring (Wit) — proved to be an effective blend in
    addressing a traditionally underserved student population.
  </p>

  <p>
    While FitWit launched new programs for students, it also began molding its defining program, the adult fitness camp.
    These early fitness camps evolved into what is now the ground-breaking FitWit training program; devoted to
    challenging fitness across all elements while tracking performance and building community within the participants.
  </p>

  <p>
    As FitWit grew, Josh and Erin wanted very much to remain true to their original vision of helping underserved
    students to be healthy and successful. To that end, in 2008, with the help of friend and former teammate Ben Thoele,
    they created the FitWit Foundation; a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation in Atlanta, Georgia.
