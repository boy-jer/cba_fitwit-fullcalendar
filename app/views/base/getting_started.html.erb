				FitWit is a personalized group-training program that has transformed thousands of lives since 2006. We're NOT your typical boot camp that runs around the park every day. Instead, we offer unique and <em>measurable</em> workouts instructed by expert coaches who care about <em>your</em> progress. AND, perhaps the biggest reason we've had over 150 campers in our program for 2+ years is our ability to effectively program workouts for EVERY fitness level. With a focus on You vs. You, our well-conditioned campers are always pushed to new levels and our new-comers to exercise are NEVER left behind.

			<p>
				At FitWit, you receive EVERYTHING you need to completely transform your life - personalized fitness instruction, workout tracking, nutrition coaching, group accountability and a new community of supporters. This community is a vital component of your transformation, and we're very serious about it â€” group socials, volunteer projects, running clubs, dinner clubs and a yearly FitWit Awards Banquet held at Zoo Atlanta.
