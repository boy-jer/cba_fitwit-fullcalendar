			<h2>
				<strong>Our Mission</strong> — The short version of what we aim to do
			</h2>
			<p>
				Create fitness camp communities that inspire and empower individuals of all fitness levels to be fit and healthy for life.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<strong>Our Story</strong> — The slightly longer version of what we aim to do
			</h2>
			<p>
				Our mission really nails it — we build fitness communities. We think life is best lived in community; thus we see a better way to do fitness than sweating in your living room alone doing Tai-Bo or aimlessly wandering around a gym. We also don't think "boot camp" has to involve getting berated by a 'real' marine or running around a park for 60 minutes. Nor do we believe fitness is held exclusively by the athletes; in fact, it may just be the only thing in life that success is guaranteed simply by trying harder than you did yesterday.
			</p>
			<p>
				We seek to better define what it means to be â€˜fit' — not only in creating unique workouts but in tying our definition to include a more sustainable approach. We offer campers the opportunity to, not only get fit, but to live fit — a viable model that goes beyond the 30-day quick fix. And it also means we give back to those without the means to afford quality fitness programs. Our story is directly tied to the communities we serve and the kids' lives we hope to improve just because people decided they wanted to get in shape themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our campers become fiercely loyal and the really cool part is that they then become part of the story —a story that has gained serious momentum in Atlanta, and one that we're excited to spread even further.
