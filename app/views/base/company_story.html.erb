<h2>Our Mission — The short version of what we aim to do</h2>

<p>Create fitness camp communities that inspire and empower individuals of all fitness levels to be fit and healthy for life. </p>

<h2>Our Story — The slightly longer version of what we aim to do</h2>

<p>Our mission really nails it — we build fitness communities. We think life is best lived in community; thus we see a better way to do fitness than sweating in your living room alone doing Tai-Bo or aimlessly wandering around a gym. We also don't think "boot camp" has to involve getting berated by a 'real' marine or running around a park for 60 minutes. Nor do we believe fitness is held exclusively by the athletes; in fact, it may just be the only thing in life that success is guaranteed simply by trying harder than you did yesterday.</p>
 
<p>We seek to better define what it means to be â€˜fit' — not only in creating unique workouts but in tying our definition to include a more sustainable approach. We offer campers the opportunity to, not only get fit, but to live fit — a viable model that goes beyond the 30-day quick fix. And it also means we give back to those without the means to afford quality fitness programs. Our story is directly tied to the communities we serve and the kids' lives we hope to improve just because people decided they wanted to get in shape themselves. </p>

<p>Our campers become fiercely loyal and the really cool part is that they then become part of the story —a story that has gained serious momentum in Atlanta, and one that we're excited to spread even further. </p>

<h2>Our History — How this adventure got started.</h2>

<p>FitWit is an Atlana-based company, created by Josh and Erin Guerrieri in 2005. Teaching in inner-city Atlanta Public Schools proved to Josh and Erin that quality fitness and tutoring programs were needed for the students they served. Combining personal fitness training (FIT) and academic tutoring (WIT) proved to be an effective tool for improving the lives of a traditionally underserved student population. </p>

<p>While FitWit launched new programs for students, it also began offering the same type of group fitness classes for adults. At that time, they saw a niche between what typical boot camps were offering and a more personal training experience closer to Crossfit. Combining the best elements of both, FitWit created a new fitness genre: group fitness training with an emphasis on individual performance improvement and a commitment to giving back to the community. </p>

<p>The original camp in the Grant Park neighborhood of Atlanta has seen exponential growth since its inception. FitWit has made it's expansion slowly in order to avoid watering-down the successful formula of recruiting quality trainers and planting roots in a community. The FitWit program has been successfully replicated in Decatur and in Midtown Atlanta, with more growth planned in the near future. </p>

<p>While FitWit grew, so did the commitment to help under-served children. So, in 2008 The FitWit Foundation was created as a non-profit organization empowering young people to lead healthy and successful lives. FitWit LLC donates revenues from every adult camp to The FitWit Foundation, which then provides free fitness opportunities for at-risk Atlanta youth, fulfilling the original vision of FitWit — building community through fitness.</p>
